## 👋 About Me

I am a Junior Cybersecurity Analyst with a background in Computer Engineering,
professional experience in a high-security institutional environment, and
hands-on training across offensive security, digital forensics, and cyber threat
intelligence.

I currently serve in the Portuguese National Republican Guard (GNR), assigned to
the Presidency of the Republic, operating in a context that requires a high
degree of trust, discipline, confidentiality, and responsibility.

Alongside my institutional role, I have built a strong technical foundation in
cybersecurity through formal education, professional training, and extensive
hands-on laboratory work focused on real-world attack, investigation, and
incident response scenarios.

I hold the eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) certification and my
work emphasizes methodology, analytical reasoning, and ethical security research,
with a clear focus on understanding attacker behavior and defensive investigation
techniques.
